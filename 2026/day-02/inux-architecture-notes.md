# Linux Architecture Notes

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system used in servers, cloud platforms, containers, and DevOps environments.

# Core Components of Linux

## 1. Kernel
The kernel is the core part of Linux that directly interacts with hardware.

### Responsibilities:
- CPU management
- Memory management
- Process scheduling
- Device management
- File system handling

The kernel works as a bridge between hardware and applications.

---

## 2. User Space
User space is where users and applications run.

### Examples:
- Bash shell
- VS Code
- Python programs
- Nginx
- Docker

Applications cannot directly access hardware.
They communicate with the kernel using system calls.

---

## 3. init / systemd
After booting, Linux starts the first process called `init` (PID 1).

Modern Linux distributions use `systemd`.

### systemd Responsibilities:
- Starts system services
- Manages background processes
- Handles service restart
- Collects logs
- Controls boot sequence

### Useful systemd Commands
bash
systemctl status nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart nginx
journalctl -u nginx

Linux Process Management
What is a Process?

A process is a running instance of a program.

Examples:

Chrome browser
Bash terminal
Python script

Each process has:

PID (Process ID)
Parent Process
Memory allocation
Process state

Process Creation

Linux mainly uses:

fork() → create child process
exec() → load new program into process

Example:
When running ls command:

Shell creates child process
Child executes ls

Process States
State	Meaning
Running	Currently using CPU
Sleeping	Waiting for resource/input
Stopped	Paused process
Zombie	Process finished but not cleaned
Orphan	Parent process terminated

Zombie processes waste process table entries and should be cleaned properly.

Why systemd Matters in DevOps

Understanding systemd helps to:

Troubleshoot failed services
Restart applications safely
Analyze logs during incidents
Manage production servers
Automate service startup

Most production Linux servers use systemd for service management.

Key Learning Summary
Kernel manages hardware and system resources
User space runs applications
systemd manages services and boot process
Processes have different states and lifecycle
Linux troubleshooting starts with understanding processes and logs
